If this bothers you, feel free to leave this article. The issue I have with ORMs is that it abstracts away SQL, which is already a very declarative way of writing data workflows. It is declarative in the sense that you write out what you want the result to look like,opposed to an imperative paradigm where you write out the explicitly steps to arrive at the result. It often time results in a n+1 problem, degrading your application performance.\nHowever, the good quality of ORM’s is that they allow you to easily map your database schema into the data types of your programming language of choice. This might be a dataclass or pydantic class in python, or a struct in golang. If you just use the built in database drivers, you often have to self-manage the mapping of raw tuples to/from the database driver back to your datatypes. This results in far more boiler plate in the codebase going back and forth between the desired datatype and tuples. It can also result in errors and code that is later hard to understand later on. To be fair though, many database drivers have the concept of row factories which allow you to map database rows directly to hash maps / classes/ structs. However, many of often unaware of this feature and even then, it still typically results in more boiler plate compared to the ORM.\nAnother nice feature of ORMs is that they often include database migration tools, or have plugins that allow you to do so. This makes managing your database between production releases much easier. It also allows an easy mechanism to roll back in the event of a bad release. Managing database migrations without some supporting tooling can be a nightmare, as the onus is on the developer to organize the migration queries in a logical manner.\nThe great news is that these two features of ORMs can also be satified using only raw sql with the help of some additional tooling. Enter DBMate and SQLC.\nDBMate - Migration Tool When developing a backend database, knowing how migrations are going to be managed needs to be one of the first considerations. DBMate is a great tool in this regard, and it is agnostic of the programming language of choice. To get started, I will build a new project for managing a database of user’s tasks. (Yeah I know, real original…) Let’s first build our directory.\n~/Projects\u003emkdir task-manager \u0026\u0026 cd task-manager ~/Projects/task-manager\u003egit init . hint: Using 'master' as the name for the initial branch. This default branch name hint: is subject to change. To configure the initial branch name to use in all hint: of your new repositories, which will suppress this warning, call: hint: hint: git config --global init.defaultBranch hint: hint: Names commonly chosen instead of 'master' are 'main', 'trunk' and hint: 'development'. The just-created branch can be renamed via this command: hint: hint: git branch -m Next lets install dbmate. I am using a linux system. If you are using a different os, refer to the installation instructions for your system.\n~/Projects/task-manager\u003esudo curl -fsSL -o /usr/local/bin/dbmate https://github.com/amacneil/dbmate/releases/latest/download/dbmate-linux-amd64 sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/dbmate /usr/local/bin/dbmate --help ~/Projects/task-manager\u003edbmate --version dbmate version 2.25.0 Now that we have DBMate installed, we need to specify what database we are targeting. For this project, I will stick to using sqlite for its simplicity of setup. We tell DBMate which database to target by setting the $DATABASE_URL environment variable. Instead of specifying this globally on my system, I will create a .env file in the project to keep it locally stored. DBMate will know to automatically parse secrets in our .env file.\nDATABASE_URL=\"sqlite:./db/task-manager.db\" We should also add any dot env files into our git ignore to prevent exposing secrets and conflicting configuration parameters into our build systems.\n*.env Now lets add our first migration.\n~/Projects/task-manager\u003edbmate new create-users Creating migration: db/migrations/20250215163420_create-users.sql We see we get a new sql file gets created. Our project file structure should now look like this.\nLets open our new sql file, and we see the following.\n-- migrate:up -- migrate:down We see there are two sections: one for migrating up the database, and other to migrate down (rollback). Lets define our steps.\n-- migrate:up create table users ( id integer primary key, name text not null ); -- migrate:down drop table users; After saving this file, we now can check the status of our migrations.\n~/Projects/task-manager\u003edbmate status [ ] 20250215170014_create-users.sql Applied: 0 Pending: 1 And then run our migration.\n~/Projects/task-manager\u003edbmate up Applying: 20250215170014_create-users.sql Applied: 20250215170014_create-users.sql in 8.189239ms Writing: ./db/schema.sql DBMate creates our database and creates the users table. To test it out, run the following in your favorite db query utility or the sqlite3 shell. (I use neovim Dadbod plugin)\ninsert into users (name) values ('test'); select * from users; You should see your test user returned back.\nTo roll back, run the following.\n~/Projects/task-manager\u003edbmate rollback Rolling back: 20250215170014_create-users.sql Rolled back: 20250215170014_create-users.sql in 3.702276ms Writing: ./db/schema.sql Now we should have an empty database again.\nTo test that, run the following.\nselect * from users; And you should see an empty result set.\nSQLC SQLC is a tool that allows you to easily generate Go code from SQL queries. Unlike ORMs, it will read through our raw sql schema and queries, and generate Go code that you can use to interact with your database. All the boiler plate of managing the database drivers and mapping raw tuples to/from Go data types is taken care of for us.\nFirst, we need to install SQLC.\n~/Projects/task-manager\u003esudo snap install sqlc ~/Projects/task-manager\u003esqlc version v1.28.0 If you are using a different os, refer to the installation instructions. Next we need to let SQLC know some things about our database.\nDatabase schema Database queries Database engine Go module name This is done in a yaml file. To initialize this file, run the following.\n~/Projects/task-manager\u003esqlc init db/sqlc.yaml sqlc.yaml is added. Please visit https://docs.sqlc.dev/en/stable/reference/config.html to learn more about configuration The output of this command gives us a link for how to format the yaml schema. Lets open the schema file, and modify it as follows.\nversion: \"2\" sql: - schema: \"db/migrations/\" queries: \"db/queries.sql\" engine: \"sqlite\" gen: go: package: \"database\" out: \"database\" The schema refers to our directory with our DBMate migrations. SQLC interops with DBMate and will automatically pull the schema from the “up” migrations and ignore the “down” migrations. The queries refer to our sql queries that our code can operate on. We can refer to a single file, like I’ve done here, or we can refer to a directory of files. I typically like to keep it all in one single file, but if you prefer many small files, go for it. The engine refers to our database, which is sqlite in this case. The gen section refers to the Go code we want to generate. In this case, we want to generate Go code under a module called database that we can import and utilize in our Go code.\nWe generate the Go code using the following command.\n~/Projects/task-manager\u003esqlc generate This will generate the following three files.\nAnd now the generated code is now available for us to use. You do not need to ever touch these files.\nPutting it all together Lets initialize our go project and add our sqlite3 database driver.\ngo mod init github.com/acswindle/task-manager go mod get github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3 And then we create our main.go file.\npackage main import ( \"context\" \"database/sql\" \"fmt\" \"github.com/acswindle/task-manager/database\" _ \"github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3\" \"log\" ) func run() error { fmt.Println(\"Running Task Manager...\") ctx := context.Background() db, err := sql.Open(\"sqlite3\", \"./db/task-manager.sqlite3\") if err != nil { return err } queries := database.New(db) // list all authors user := \"John Doe\" id, err := queries.InsertUser(ctx, user) if err != nil { return err } fmt.Printf(\"Created user %s with ID: %d\\n\", user, id) return nil } func main() { if err := run(); err != nil { log.Fatal(err) } } And then build and run our program.\n~/Projects/task-manager\u003ego run . Running Task Manager... Created user John Doe with ID: 1 Awesome, we were able to add a user to our database.\nTo wrap things up, lets try to return a list of users. Lets add the following to our queries.sql file.\n-- name: GetUsers :many select * from users; And regenerate our go database module.\n~/Projects/task-manager\u003esqlc generate And then add the following to the end our of run function.\nusers, err := queries.GetUsers(ctx) if err != nil { return err } for _, user := range users { fmt.Printf(\"Found user %s with ID: %d\\n\", user.Name, user.ID) } ~/Projects/task-manager\u003ego run . Running Task Manager... Created user John Doe with ID: 2 Found user John Doe with ID: 1 Found user John Doe with ID: 2 And viola, we have returned a list of users from our database.\nYou can check out the source code in its entirety here\nNext time we will see how to use this project to implement a simple Rest API in go. Until next time 🍻\n","wordCount":"1515","inLanguage":"en","image":"http://localhost:1313/personal-blog/posts/database-project-setup/database-cover.jpg","datePublished":"2025-02-15T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-02-15T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Chase"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:1313/personal-blog/posts/database-project-setup/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Chase's Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://localhost:1313/personal-blog/static/icon.png"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://localhost:1313/personal-blog/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=http://localhost:1313/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/personal-blog/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/personal-blog/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=http://localhost:1313/personal-blog/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=http://localhost:1313/personal-blog/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">DBMate and SQLC - Super Charge Your Database Workflow</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2025-02-15 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 15, 2025</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;8 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1515 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Chase&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/acswindle/personal-blog/content/posts/database-project-setup/index.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><figure class=entry-cover><img loading=eager srcset="http://localhost:1313/personal-blog/posts/database-project-setup/database-cover_hu_8e4318ac0df5cdb8.jpg 360w ,http://localhost:1313/personal-blog/posts/database-project-setup/database-cover_hu_44b26aa562a738bd.jpg 480w ,http://localhost:1313/personal-blog/posts/database-project-setup/database-cover_hu_4526d9c3ae1f26d0.jpg 720w ,http://localhost:1313/personal-blog/posts/database-project-setup/database-cover.jpg 900w" sizes="(min-width: 768px) 720px, 100vw" src=http://localhost:1313/personal-blog/posts/database-project-setup/database-cover.jpg alt width=900 height=720></figure><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#introduction>Introduction</a></li><li><a href=#dbmate---migration-tool>DBMate - Migration Tool</a></li><li><a href=#sqlc>SQLC</a></li><li><a href=#putting-it-all-together>Putting it all together</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><h2 id=introduction>Introduction<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#introduction>#</a></h2><p>Let me start this off by saying one thing, I am not a fan of ORMs

Unlike ORMs, it will read through our raw sql schema and queries, and generate
Go code that you can use to interact with your database. All the boiler plate
of managing the database drivers and mapping raw tuples to/from Go data types
is taken care of for us.</p><p>First, we need to install SQLC.</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span class=line><span class=cl>~/Projects/task-manager&gt;sudo snap install sqlc
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>~/Projects/task-manager&gt;sqlc version
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>v1.28.0
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If you are using a different os, refer to the <a href=https://docs.sqlc.dev/en/latest/overview/install.html>installation instructions</a>.
Next we need to let SQLC know some things about our database.</p><ol><li>Database schema</li><li>Database queries</li><li>Database engine</li><li>Go module name</li></ol><p>This is done in a yaml file. To initialize this file, run the following.</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span class=line><span class=cl>~/Projects/task-manager&gt;sqlc init db/sqlc.yaml
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>sqlc.yaml is added. Please visit https://docs.sqlc.dev/en/stable/reference/config.html to learn more about configuration
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The output of this command gives us a <a href=https://docs.sqlc.dev/en/stable/reference/config.html>link</a> for how to format the yaml schema.
Lets open the schema file, and modify it as follows.</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-yaml data-lang=yaml><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=nt>version</span><span class=p>:</span><span class=w> </span><span class=s2>&#34;2&#34;</span><span class=w>

</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>The schema refers to our directory with our DBMate migrations.
SQLC interops with DBMate and will automatically pull the schema from the
&ldquo;up&rdquo; migrations and ignore the &ldquo;down&rdquo; migrations. The queries refer to our
sql queries that our code can operate on. We can refer to a single file,
like I&rsquo;ve done here, or we can refer to a directory of files. I typically
like to keep it all in one single file, but if you prefer many small files,
go for it. The engine refers to our database, which is sqlite in this case.
The gen section refers to the Go code we want to generate. In this case,
we want to generate Go code under a module called database that we can
import and utilize in our Go code.</p><p>We generate the Go code using the following command.</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span class=line><span class=cl>~/Projects/task-manager&gt;sqlc generate
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This will generate the following three files.</p><p><img alt="three files" loading=lazy src=/personal-blog/posts/database-project-setup/three-files.png></p><p>And now the generated code is now available for us to use.
You do not need to ever touch these files.</p><h2 id=putting-it-all-together>Putting it all together<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#putting-it-all-together>#</a></h2><p>Lets initialize our go project and add our sqlite3 database driver.</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span class=line><span class=cl>go mod init github.com/acswindle/task-manager
